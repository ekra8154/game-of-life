Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

This is a personal project I developed to practice at JavaScript and to practice using AI tools as a coding assistant.
It simulates Conway's Game of Life as an interactive simulation, with additional visual and control features to make it more engaging.
This project helped me get better at canvas transforms, simulation timing, and javascript organization.
It also helped me practice how to use AI tools effectively in a way to plan, debug, and optimize my code.

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that evolves independently based on some simple rules.
Each cell on a grid is alive or dead, and at each step of the simulation, its state changes based on the number of neighbors it has.
A live cell with two or three neighbors survives, a dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life, and everything else dies or stays dead.

The project includes several features:
- Zooming and panning so you can explore different parts of the grid
- Speed control and the ability to pause the simulation
- Visual effects such as movement trails and color shifting
- Preset shapes like gliders, oscillators, and walls
